I'm trying to do an Rails Map Application.

v0.5- added backoffice with rails_admin

v0.4- added user control with Devise gem and some post management

v0.3- added different markers for different categorys. Each category will have a different icon.
      now is possible to list places by category also

v0.2- Added list with point in maps
      added directions from user browser location
      Associated category with place in map
      

v0.1- Right now i'm trying to iterate over the map.
      The main page is loading one map with all the markers.
      I want the database to load many maps with one marker per map.
